Understanding the code
For the first homework, write a program (called hello.cpp) in C++ that prints "hello world" to the console (also called standard out). Be prepared to talk about all the parts of the program. Feel free to use the web for examples. Make sure it compiles without warnings or errors and generally make sure it works as intended.![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85704270/161628159-6da7a5aa-45d2-4d20-b6d5-d34094ede673.png)
